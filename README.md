# Slay the Spire exporter - for Slay the Relics Twitch extension

Use this mod to export card art from your content mod to be served using the Slay the Relics Twitch extension.

## How to use it

1. Load this mod (see releases for .jar) and the mod you want to export with ModTheSpire. In the game click on 'mods' -> 'Spire Exporter' -> 'config'

2. Make sure 'Export items from the basegame' is unchecked

3. Click 'Export now'

4. Go to SlayTheSpire/export/str/img/cards/ there should be a folder that's named after your mod

5. Check inside the folder that your card art has been exported correctly. You should see card backgrounds, card frames, energy orb and portrait folder that contains all the card portraits.

    - If it did - zip the folder (the root one that's named after the mod) and send it to adam (@) slaytherelics.xyz
    
    - If it didn't - you can clone this fork and try to see what's wrong and fix it. If you're not sure how, you can hit me up at the email.
